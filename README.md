# My Personal Emacs Configs

## Background
I was contemplating about putting up my configs online, but then I had to move computers.
I found physically moving the files to be too tedious, so now the public parts of the configs are on Github.

## News

* 2019-01-06: New Year, New Version; I am finally moving my init config to fully support the new (and changed) features of major version 26.
  The transition initially started before the new year, but since v25 was still working fine, there was little to motivate the move.
  It was only when I started to review the code that I found how "clunky" some of the code was that a move to v26 was deemed necessary.
  Most notable change is:
  - `linum-mode` to `display-line-numbers-mode`

## Ground Rules
Anyone can
* reference/fork my settings
* report issues
* make pull requests for issues

However, please do not do the following:

1. Report issues to _request features_
2. Make a PR for purposes *_other than_ for fixing issues*
