# My Personal Emacs Configs

## Background
I was contemplating about putting up my configs online, but then I had to move computers.  
I found physically moving the files to be too tedious, so now the configs are on
Github.

## Ground Rules
Anyone can
* reference my settings (a.k.a. fork it)
* report issues
* make pull requests for issues

## Note
Please do not do the following:

1. Report issues to _request features_
2. Make a PR for purposes *_other than_ for fixing issues*
